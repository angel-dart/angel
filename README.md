**A polished, production-ready backend framework in Dart.**

-----
## About
Angel is a full-stack Web framework in Dart. It aims to
streamline development by providing many common features
out-of-the-box in a consistent manner.

With features like the following, Angel is the all-in-one framework you should choose to build your next project:
* [GraphQL Support](https://github.com/angel-dart/graphql)
* [PostgreSQL ORM](https://github.com/angel-dart/orm)
* [Dependency Injection](https://docs.angel-dart.dev/guides/dependency-injection)
* And [much more](https://github.com/angel-dart)...

## Installation & Setup

Once you have [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) installed, bootstrapping a project is as simple as running a few shell commands:

Install the [Angel CLI](https://github.com/angel-dart/cli):

```bash
pub global activate angel_cli
```

Bootstrap a project:

```bash
angel init hello
```

You can even have your server run and be *hot-reloaded* on file changes:

```bash
dart --observe bin/dev.dart
```

Next, check out the [detailed documentation](https://docs.angel-dart.dev/v/2.x) to learn to flesh out your project.
