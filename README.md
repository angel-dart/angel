* GraphQL Support
* PostgreSQL ORM

* Static File Handling
* And much more...

See all the packages in the `packages/` directory.

## Installation & Setup

Once you have [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) installed, bootstrapping a project is as simple as running a few shell commands:

Install the [Angel CLI](https://github.com/angel-dart/cli):

```bash
pub global activate angel_cli
```

Bootstrap a project:

```bash
angel init hello
```

You can even have your server run and be *hot-reloaded* on file changes:

```bash
dart --observe bin/dev.dart
```

Next, check out the [detailed documentation](https://docs.angel-dart.dev/v/2.x) to learn to flesh out your project.
